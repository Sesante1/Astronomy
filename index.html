                                to the Sun. Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is
                                covered in tens of thousands of impact craters.

                                Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. 
                                Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is
                                sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps 
                                heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest

                                Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a

                                planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, 
                                it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight 
                                light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a

                                Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive

                                Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus).
                                Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" 
                                materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core.

                                Uranus is a very cold and windy world. 
                                The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons. 
                                Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. 
                                This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.

                                Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf

                                about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) 
                                from Earth and it's our solar system's only star. 
                                Without the Sun's energy, life as we know it 
                                could not exist on our home planet.
